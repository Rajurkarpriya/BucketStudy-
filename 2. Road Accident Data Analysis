🚦 Regulatory Affairs of Road Accident Data 2020 – Internship Project at BucketStudy
📌 Project Type: Road Safety Data Analysis
📌 Tools & Technologies: SQL, Excel, PowerPoint
📌 Dataset: Urban road accident data categorized by city, outcome type, and cause.

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data across various cities to uncover key safety insights such as:

Cities with the highest count of road incidents.

Distribution of minor injury outcomes where incident count exceeds 15.

Most frequent causes and outcomes of accidents.

City-wise ranking for different cause categories.

Trends and patterns to assist policymakers in reducing accidents.

The analysis was performed using SQL for querying and pattern recognition, Excel for dataset overview, and PowerPoint for structured data storytelling.

🛠 How I Solved Data Challenges
🔹 Initial Data View & Setup: Imported table, renamed it, and checked column data types.
🔹 Missing Data Handling: Checked for null values to ensure completeness.
🔹 SQL-Based Analysis: Used functions like GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and conditional filters to extract insights.
🔹 Ranking & Filtering: Highlighted cities with more than 15 incidents and categorized outcomes by cause.

📊 Key Analysis Highlights
✅ Top cities with the highest minor injuries
✅ Most frequent cause-outcome pairs
✅ Outcome distribution by city
✅ Incident counts by cause categories and subcategories
✅ Cities with both highest and lowest incident rates

💡 Key Learnings & Outcomes
📌 Strengthened SQL querying and filtering skills
📌 Improved understanding of urban safety and accident trends
📌 Learned how to structure and present actionable insights for decision-makers

🌍 World Population Analysis – Internship Project at BucketStudy
📌 Project Type: Demographic Data Analysis
📌 Tools & Technologies: Microsoft Excel, Power Query
📌 Dataset: Global population data from 1970 to 2022, including country-wise and continent-wise population and density stats.

📌 Project Overview
This project examines worldwide population trends over five decades, focusing on:

Year-wise and region-wise population growth.

Population density of world capitals.

Demographic shifts across continents.

Impact of urbanization on population patterns.

Comparative analysis of area vs. density for capitals.

Using Microsoft Excel with Power Query, the project emphasizes data transformation and visualization to uncover key population insights useful for planning and development.

🛠 How I Solved Data Challenges
🔹 Data Cleaning with Power Query: Changed data types, unpivoted data, and added new columns to organize historical population data.
🔹 Data Transformation: Structured population data for clear comparison and analysis.
🔹 Visualization: Used Excel to build dynamic dashboards and charts that highlight key population indicators over time.

📊 Charts & Dashboards Created
✅ Top Countries by Population
✅ Yearly Population Trend
✅ Continent-wise Population Comparison
✅ Capital Cities by Population Density
✅ Capital Cities by Area
✅ Dashboards – Comprehensive summary of visual insights

💡 Key Learnings & Outcomes
📌 Strengthened Excel and Power Query skills for real-world data analysis
📌 Gained understanding of population growth patterns and urban density
📌 Improved data storytelling using visual dashboards

📂 Project Files
📁 population_analysis.xlsx → Excel workbook with dashboards and charts
